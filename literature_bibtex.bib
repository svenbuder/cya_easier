@article{Grevesse2007,
	abstract = {{We present our current knowledge of the solar chemical composition based
on the recent significant downward revision of the solar photospheric
abundances of the most abundant metals. These new solar abundances
result from the use of a 3D hydrodynamic model of the solar atmosphere
instead of the classical 1D hydrostatic models, accounting for
departures from LTE, and improved atomic and molecular data. With these
abundances, the new solar metallicity, Z, decreases to Z=0.012, almost a
factor of two lower than earlier widely used values. We compare our
values with data from other sources and analyse a number of impacts of
these new photospheric abundances. While resolving a number of
longstanding problems, the new 3D-based solar photospheric composition
also poses serious challenges for the standard solar model as judged by
helioseismology.

	abstract = {{The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our
understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both the Sun
and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard
against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are
compared. In this review, we evaluate the current understanding of the
solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a
redetermination of the abundances of nearly all available elements,
using a realistic new three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent
hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully
considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and
accounted for departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)
whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous
compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy
findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N, O, and Ne compared
to the widely used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical
composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency
between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values
obtained in the Solar Neighborhood and from the most pristine
meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of
the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has
yet to find a satisfactory resolution.

	abstract = {{We re-evaluate the abundances of the elements in the Sun from copper (Z
= 29) to thorium (Z = 90). Our results are mostly based on neutral and
singly-ionised lines in the solar spectrum. We use the latest 3D
hydrodynamic solar model atmosphere, and in a few cases also correct for
departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) using non-LTE
(NLTE) calculations performed in 1D. In order to minimise statistical
and systematic uncertainties, we make stringent line selections, employ
the highest-quality observational data and carefully assess oscillator
strengths, hyperfine constants and isotopic separations available in the
literature, for every line included in our analysis. Our results are
typically in good agreement with the abundances in the most pristine
meteorites, but there are some interesting exceptions. This analysis
constitutes both a full exposition and a slight update of the relevant
parts of the preliminary results we presented in Asplund et al. (2009,
ARA{\amp}A, 47, 481), including full line lists and details of all input
data that we have employed.

	abstract = {{To understand the formation and evolution of solar-type stars in the
solar neighborhood, we need to measure their stellar parameters to high
accuracy. We present a catalogue of accurate stellar parameters for 451
stars that represent the HARPS Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO)
{\ldquo}high precision{\rdquo} sample. Spectroscopic stellar parameters
were measured using high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra acquired with the
HARPS spectrograph. The spectroscopic analysis was completed assuming
LTE with a grid of Kurucz atmosphere models and the recent ARES code for
measuring line equivalent widths. We show that our results agree well
with those ones presented in the literature (for stars in common). We
present a useful calibration for the effective temperature as a function
of the index color B-V and [Fe/H]. We use our results to study the
metallicity-planet correlation, namely for very low mass planets. The
results presented here suggest that in contrast to their jovian
couterparts, neptune-like planets do not form preferentially around
metal-rich stars. The ratio of jupiter-to-neptunes is also an increasing
function of stellar metallicity. These results are discussed in the
context of the core-accretion model for planet formation.

grid of Kurucz atmosphere models and using the ARES code to perform an
automatic measurement of the line equivalent widths. The results are
compared with different independent methods and also with other values
found in the literature for common stars. Both comparisons are
consistent and illustrate the homogeneity of the parameters derived by
our team. The derived metallicities of this sample reveal a somewhat
different distribution for the present planet hosts, but still indicates
the already known higher frequency of planets observed for the more
metal-rich stars. We combine the results derived in this sample with the
one from the CORALIE survey to present the largest homogeneous
spectroscopic study of the metallicity-giant-planet relation using a

	abstract = {{For the first time, we present an extensive study of stars with
individual non-LTE (NLTE) abundances for 17 chemical elements from Li to
Eu in a sample of stars uniformly distributed over the -2.62 {\le} [Fe/H]
{\le} +0.24 metallicity range that is suitable for the Galactic chemical
evolution research. The star sample has been kinematically selected to
trace the Galactic thin and thick disks and halo. We find new results
and improve earlier ones as follows: (I) the element-to-iron ratios for
Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti form a metal-poor (MP) plateau at a similar height of
0.3 dex, and the knee occurs at common [Fe/H] {\sime} -0.8. The knee at
the same metallicity is observed for [O/Fe], and the MP plateau is
formed at [O/Fe] = 0.61. (II) The upward trend of [C/O] with decreasing
metallicity exists at [Fe/H] $\lt$ -1.2, supporting the earlier finding
of Akerman et al. (III) An underabundance of Na relative to Mg in the
[Fe/H] $\lt$ -1 stars is nearly constant, with the mean [Na/ Mg] {\sime}
-0.5. (IV) The K/Sc, Ca/Sc, and Ti/Sc ratios form well-defined trends,
suggesting a common site of the K-Ti production. (v) Sr follows the Fe
abundance down to [Fe/H] {\sime} -2.5, while Zr is enhanced in MP stars.
(VI) The comparisons of our results with some widely used Galactic
evolution models are given. The use of the NLTE element abundances gives
increased credit to the interpretation of the data in the context of the
chemical evolution of the Galaxy.

with T$_{eff}$ K, -1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4, and distances D
{\lap} 335 pc. Most of them have halo kinematics, but 16 thick-disk stars
are included. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent widths of atomic lines are
measured from VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra with resolutions R{\sime} 55
000 and R {\sime} 40 000, respectively. An LTE abundance analysis based
on MARCS models is applied to derive precise differential abundance
ratios of Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with respect to Fe. <BR />
Results: The halo stars fall into two populations, clearly separated in
[{$\alpha$}/Fe], where {$\alpha$} refers to the average abundance of Mg, Si,
Ca, and Ti. Differences in [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe] are also present with a
remarkably clear correlation between these two abundance ratios. <BR />
Conclusions: The {\ldquo}high-{$\alpha$}{\rdquo} stars may be ancient disk or
bulge stars {\ldquo}heated{\rdquo} to halo kinematics by merging satellite
galaxies or they could have formed as the first stars during the
collapse of a proto-Galactic gas cloud. The kinematics of the
{\ldquo}low-{$\alpha$}{\rdquo} stars suggest that they have been accreted
from dwarf galaxies, and that some of them may originate from the
{$\omega$} Cen progenitor galaxy.

	abstract = {{Context. Current models of galaxy formation predict that the Galactic
halo was assembled hierarchically. By measuring abundance ratios in
stars it may be possible to identify substructures in the halo resulting
from this process. <BR /> Aims: A previous study of 94 dwarf stars with
-1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.4 in the solar neighborhood has revealed the
existence of two distinct halo populations with a systematic difference
in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] at a given metallicity. In continuation of that work,
abundances of Mn, Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba are determined for the same sample
of stars. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent widths of atomic lines are measured
from high resolution VLT/UVES and NOT/FIES spectra and used to derive
abundance ratios from an LTE analysis based on MARCS model atmospheres.
The analysis is made relative to two thick-disk stars, <ASTROBJ>HD
22879</ASTROBJ> and <ASTROBJ>HD 76932</ASTROBJ>, such that very precise
differential values are obtained. <BR /> Results: Systematic differences
between the ``high-{$\alpha$}'' and ``low-{$\alpha$}'' halo populations are found
for [Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Ba/Y], whereas there is no significant
difference in the case of [Mn/Fe]. At a given metallicity, [Cu/Fe] shows
a large scatter that is closely correlated with a corresponding scatter
in [Na/Fe] and [Ni/Fe]. <BR /> Conclusions: The metallicity trends of
[Cu/Fe], [Zn/Fe], and [Ba/Y] can be explained from existing
nucleosynthesis calculations if the high-{$\alpha$} stars formed in regions
with such a high star formation rate that only massive stars and type II
supernovae contributed to the chemical enrichment. The low-{$\alpha$}
stars, on the other hand, most likely originate from systems with a
slower chemical evolution, characterized by additional enrichment from
type Ia supernovae and low-mass AGB stars.

@article{Nissen2012,
	abstract = {{Context. A previous study of F and G main-sequence stars in the solar
neighborhood has revealed the existence of two distinct halo populations
with a clear separation in [{$\alpha$}/Fe] for the metallicity range -1.4
$\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$ -0.7. Taking into account the kinematics and ages of
the stars, some Galactic formation models suggest that the ``high-alpha''
halo stars were formed in situ, whereas the ``low-alpha'' stars have been
accreted from satellite galaxies. <BR /> Aims: In this paper we
investigate if there is a systematic difference in the lithium
abundances of stars belonging to the high- and low-alpha halo
populations. <BR /> Methods: Equivalent widths of the Li i 6707.8
{\AA} resonance line are measured from high resolution VLT/UVES and
NOT/FIES spectra and used to derive Li abundances on the basis of MARCS
model atmospheres. Furthermore, masses of the stars are determined from
the log T$_{eff}$ - log g diagram by interpolating between
evolutionary tracks based on Yonsei-Yale models. <BR /> Results: There
is no significant systematic difference in the lithium abundances of
high- and low-alpha stars. For the large majority of stars with masses
0.7 $\lt$ M/M$_{&sun;}$ $\lt$ 0.9 and heavy-element mass fractions
0.001 {\lsim} Z $\lt$ 0.006, the lithium abundance is well fitted by a
relation A(Li) = a$_{0}$ + a$_{1}$ M + a$_{2}$ Z +
a$_{3}$ M Z, where a$_{0}$, a$_{1}$, a$_{2}$,
and a$_{3}$ are constants. Extrapolating this relation to Z = 0
leads to a lithium abundance close to the primordial value predicted
from standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis calculations and the WMAP baryon
density. The relation, however, does not apply to stars with
metallicities below [Fe/H] {\sime} - 1.5. <BR /> Conclusions: We suggest
that metal-rich halo stars were formed with a lithium abundance close to
the primordial value, and that lithium in their atmospheres has been
depleted in time with an approximately linear dependence on stellar mass
and Z. The lack of a systematic difference in the Li abundances of high-
and low-alpha stars indicates that an environmental effect is not
important for the destruction of lithium.

	abstract = {{Context. Carbon and oxygen abundances in stars are important in many
fields of astrophysics including nucleosynthesis, stellar structure,
evolution of galaxies, and formation of planetary systems. Still, our
knowledge of the abundances of these elements in different stellar
populations is uncertain because of difficulties in observing and
analyzing atomic and molecular lines of C and O. <BR /> Aims: Abundances
of C, O, and Fe are determined for F and G main-sequence stars in the
solar neighborhood with metallicities in the range -1.6 $\lt$ [Fe/H] $\lt$
+0.4 in order to study trends and possible systematic differences in the
C/Fe, O/Fe, and C/O ratios for thin- and thick-disk stars as well as
high- and low-alpha halo stars. In addition, we investigate if there is
any connection between C and O abundances in stellar atmospheres and the
occurrence of planets. <BR /> Methods: Carbon abundances are determined
from the {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$} 5052,5380 C i lines and oxygen abundances from
the {$\lambda$}7774 O i triplet and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300
{\AA}. MARCS model atmospheres are applied and non-LTE corrections for
the O i triplet are included. <BR /> Results: Systematic differences
between high- and low-alpha halo stars and between thin- and thick-disk
stars are seen in the trends of [C/Fe] and [O/Fe]. The two halo
populations and thick-disk stars show the same trend of [C/O] versus
[O/H], whereas the thin-disk stars are shifted to higher [C/O] values.
Furthermore, we find some evidence of higher C/O and C/Fe ratios in
stars hosting planets than in stars for which no planets have been
detected. <BR /> Conclusions: The results suggest that C and O in both
high- and low-alpha halo stars and in thick-disk stars are made mainly
in massive (M$\gt$ 8 M$_{&sun;}$) stars, whereas thin-disk stars
have an additional carbon contribution from low-mass AGB and massive
stars of high metallicity causing a rising trend of the C/O ratio with
increasing metallicity. However, at the highest metallicities
investigated ([Fe/H] {\sime} + 0.4), C/O does not exceed 0.8, which seems
to exclude formation of carbon planets if proto-planetary disks have the
same composition as their parent stars.

stellar populations within our Galaxy it is essential to combine
detailed kinematical and chemical information for large samples of
stars. The aim of this work is to explore the chemical abundances of
neutron capture elements which are a product of different
nucleosynthesis processes taking place in diverse objects in the Galaxy,
such as massive stars, asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars and
supernovae (SNe) explosions. <BR /> Methods: We derive chemical
abundances of Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Eu for a large sample
of more than 1000 FGK dwarf stars with high-resolution (R   115 000) and
high-quality spectra from the HARPS-GTO program. The abundances are
derived by a standard local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) analysis
using measured equivalent widths (EWs) injected to the code MOOG and a
grid of Kurucz ATLAS9 atmospheres. <BR /> Results: We find that thick
disc stars are chemically disjunct for Zn and Eu and also show on
average higher Zr but lower Ba and Y than the thin disc stars. We also
discovered that the previously identified high-{$\alpha$} metal-rich
population is also enhanced in Cu, Zn, Nd, and Eu with respect to the
thin disc but presents lower Ba and Y abundances on average, following
the trend of thick disc stars towards higher metallities and further
supporting the different chemical composition of this population. By
making a qualitative comparison of O (pure {$\alpha$}), Mg, Eu (pure
r-process), and s-process elements we can distinguish between the
contribution of the more massive stars (SNe II for {$\alpha$} and r-process
elements) and the lower mass stars (AGBs) whose contribution to the
enrichment of the Galaxy is delayed, due to their longer lifetimes. The
ratio of heavy-s to light-s elements of thin disc stars presents the
expected behaviour (increasing towards lower metallicities) and can be
explained by a major contribution of low-mass AGB stars for s-process
production at disc metallicities. However, the opposite trend found for
thick disc stars suggests that intermediate-mass AGB stars play an
important role in the enrichment of the gas from where these stars
formed. Previous works in the literature also point to a possible
primary production of light-s elements at low metallicities to explain
this trend. Finally, we also find an enhancement of light-s elements in
the thin disc at super-solar metallicities which could be caused by the
contribution of metal-rich AGB stars. <BR /> Conclusions: This work
proves the utility of homogeneous and high-quality data of modest sample
sizes. We find some interesting trends that might help to differentiate
thin and thick disc population (such as [Zn/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] ratios) and
that can also provide useful constraints for Galactic chemical evolution
models of the different populations in the Galaxy.

@article{Battistini2015,
	abstract = {{Context. Elements heavier than Li are produced in the interiors of
stars. However, for many elements the exact production sites and the
timescales on which they are dispersed into the interstellar medium are
unknown. Having a clear picture on the origins of the elements is
important for our ability to trace and understand the formation and
chemical evolution of the Milky Way and its stellar populations. <BR />
Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the origin and evolution
of Sc, V, Mn, and Co for a homogeneous and statistically significant
sample of stars probing the different populations of the Milky Way, in
particular the thin and thick disks. <BR /> Methods: Using
high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE, FEROS, SOFIN, FIES,
UVES, and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co abundances
for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. The
method is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional,
plane-parallel, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model stellar
atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. The non-LTE (NLTE)
corrections from the literature were applied to Mn and Co. <BR />
Results: We find that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V
(466 stars), and Co (567 stars) are very similar to what has been
observed for the {$\alpha$}-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the
contrary, Mn (569 stars) is generally underabundant relative to the Sun
(i.e., [ Mn/Fe ] $\lt$ 0) for [ Fe/H ] $\lt$ 0. In addition, for Mn, when
NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is almost flat over
the entire metallicity range of the stars in our sample (-2 {\lsim} [
Fe/H ] {\lsim} + 0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small
separation between the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they
completely overlap. For Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe], but
only when NLTE corrections are used. Comparisons with Ti as a reference
element show flat trends for all the elements except for Mn that show
well separated [Mn/Ti]-[Ti/H] trends for the thin and thick disks. <BR
/> Conclusions: The elements Sc and V present trends compatible with
production from type II supernovae (SNII) events. In addition, Sc
clearly shows a metallicity dependence for [ Fe/H ] $\lt$ -1. Instead, Mn
is produced in SNII events for [ Fe/H ] {\lsim} -0.4 and then type Ia
supernovae start to produce Mn. Finally, Co appears to be produced
mainly in SNII with suggestion of enrichment from hypernovae at low
metallicities.

@article{Battistini2016,
	abstract = {{Context. Elements heavier than iron are produced through neutron-capture
processes in the different phases of stellar evolution. Asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars are believed to be mainly responsible for elements
that form through the slow neutron-capture process, while the elements
created in the rapid neutron-capture process have production sites that
are less understood. Knowledge of abundance ratios as functions of
metallicity can lead to insight into the origin and evolution of our
Galaxy and its stellar populations. <BR /> Aims: We aim to trace the
chemical evolution of the neutron-capture elements Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd,
Sm, and Eu in the Milky Way stellar disk. This will allow us to
constrain the formation sites of these elements, as well as to probe the
evolution of the Galactic thin and thick disks. <BR /> Methods: Using
spectra of high resolution (42 000 {\lsim} R {\lsim} 65 000) and high
signal-to-noise (S/N {\gsim} 200) obtained with the MIKE and the FEROS
spectrographs, we determine Sr, Zr, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu abundances
for a sample of 593 F and G dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood. The
abundance analysis is based on spectral synthesis using one-dimensional,
plane-parallel, local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model stellar
atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012 code. <BR /> Results: We
present abundance results for Sr (156 stars), Zr (311 stars), La (242
stars), Ce (365 stars), Nd (395 stars), Sm (280 stars), and Eu (378
stars). We find that Nd, Sm, and Eu show trends similar to what is
observed for the {$\alpha$} elements in the [X/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance plane.
For [Sr/Fe] and [Zr/Fe], we find decreasing abundance ratios for
increasing metallicity, reaching sub-solar values at super-solar
metallicities. [La/Fe] and [Ce/Fe] do not show any clear trend with
metallicity, and they are close to solar values at all [Fe/H]. The
trends of abundance ratios [X/Fe] as a function of stellar ages present
different slopes before and after 8 Gyr. <BR /> Conclusions: The rapid
neutron-capture process is active early in the Galaxy, mainly in type-II
supernovae from stars in the mass range 8-10 M$_{&sun;}$. Europium
is almost completely produced by the r-process, but Nd and Sm show
similar trends to Eu even if their s-process component is higher.
Strontium and Zr are thought to be mainly produced by the s-process, but
show significant enrichment at low metallicity that requires extra
r-process production, which probably is different from the classical
r-process. Finally, La and Ce are mainly produced via s-process from AGB
stars in the mass range 2-4 M$_{&sun;}$, which can be seen by the
decrease in [La/Eu] and [Ce/Eu] at [Fe/H] {\ap} -0.5. The trend of [X/Fe]
with age could be explained by considering that the decrease in [X/Fe]
for the thick disk stars can be due to the decrease in type-II
supernovae with time, meaning a reduced enrichment of r-process elements
in the interstellar medium. In the thin disk, the trends are flatter,
which is probably due to the main production from the s-process being
balanced by Fe production from type-Ia supernovae.

	abstract = {{Context. We performed a uniform and detailed abundance analysis of 12
refractory elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni, Co, Sc, Mn, and V)
for a sample of 1111 FGK dwarf stars from the HARPS GTO planet search
program. Of these stars, 109 are known to harbor giant planetary
companions and 26 stars are exclusively hosting Neptunians and
super-Earths. <BR /> Aims: The two main goals of this paper are to
investigate whether there are any differences between the elemental
abundance trends for stars of different stellar populations and to
characterize the planet host and non-host samples in terms of their
[X/H]. The extensive study of this sample, focused on the abundance
differences between stars with and without planets will be presented in
a parallel paper. <BR /> Methods: The equivalent widths of spectral
lines were automatically measured from HARPS spectra with the ARES code.
The abundances of the chemical elements were determined using an LTE
abundance analysis relative to the Sun, with the 2010 revised version of
the spectral synthesis code MOOG and a grid of Kurucz ATLAS9
atmospheres. To separate the Galactic stellar populations we applied
both a purely kinematical approach and a chemical method. <BR />
Results: We found that the chemically separated (based on the Mg, Si,
and Ti abundances) thin- and thick disks are also chemically disjunct
for Al, Sc, Co, and Ca. Some bifurcation might also exist for Na, V, Ni,
and Mn, but there is no clear boundary of their [X/Fe] ratios. We
confirm that an overabundance in giant-planet host stars is clear for
all studied elements.We also confirm that stars hosting only
Neptunian-like planets may be easier to detect around stars with similar
metallicities than around non-planet hosts, although for some elements
(particulary {$\alpha$}-elements) the lower limit of [X/H] is very abrupt.

	abstract = {{We present a detailed elemental abundance study of 90 F and G dwarf,
turn-off, and subgiant stars in the Galactic bulge. Based on
high-resolution spectra acquired during gravitational microlensing
events, stellar ages and abundances for 11 elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca,
Ti, Cr, Fe, Zn, Y and Ba) have been determined. Four main findings are
presented: (1) a wide metallicity distribution with distinct peaks at
[Fe/H] = -1.09, -0.63, -0.20, + 0.12, + 0.41; (2) ahigh fraction of
intermediate-age to young stars where at [Fe/H] $\gt$ 0 more than 35\% are
younger than 8 Gyr, and for [Fe/H] {\lsim} -0.5 most stars are 10 Gyr or
older; (3) several episodes of significant star formation in the bulge
has been identified: 3, 6, 8, and 11 Gyr ago; (4) tentatively the ``knee''
in the {$\alpha$}-element abundance trends of the sub-solar metallicity
bulge is located at a slightly higher [Fe/H] than in the local thick
disk. These findings show that the Galactic bulge has complex age and
abundance properties that appear to be tightly connected to the main
Galactic stellar populations. In particular, the peaks in the
metallicity distribution, the star formation episodes, and the abundance
trends, show similarities with the properties of the Galactic thin and
thick disks. At the same time, the star formation rate appears to have
been slightly faster in the bulge than in the local thick disk, which
most likely is an indication of the denser stellar environment closer to
the Galactic centre. There are also additional components not seen
outside the bulge region, and that most likely can be associated with
the Galactic bar. Our results strengthen the observational evidence that
support the idea of a secular origin for the Galactic bulge, formed out
of the other main Galactic stellar populations present in the central
regions of our Galaxy. Additionally, our analysis of this enlarged
sample suggests that the (V-I)$_{0}$ colour of the bulge red clump
should be revised to 1.09.

@article{Bensby2018,
	abstract = {{Despite the recent availability of large samples of stars with high-
        precision Li abundances, there are many unanswered questions
        about the evolution of this unique element in the Galaxy and in
        the stars themselves. It is unclear which parameters and
        physical mechanisms govern Li depletion in late-type stars and
        if Galactic enrichment has proceeded differently in different
        stellar populations. With this study we aim to explore these
        questions further by mapping the evolution of Li with stellar
        mass, age, and effective temperature for Milky Way disk stars,
        linking the metal-poor and metal-rich regimes, and how Li
        differs in the thin and thick disks. We determine Li abundances
        for a well-studied sample of 714 F and G dwarf, turn-off, and
        subgiant stars in the solar neighbourhood. The analysis is based
        on line synthesis of the $^{7}$Li line at 6707 {\r{A}} in high-
        resolution and high-signal-to-noise ratio echelle spectra,
        obtained with the MIKE, FEROS, SOFIN, UVES, and FIES
        spectrographs. The presented Li abundances are corrected for
        non-LTE effects. Out of the sample of 714 stars, we are able to
        determine Li abundances for 394 stars and upper limits on the Li
        abundance for another 121 stars. Out of 36 stars that are listed
        as exoplanet host stars, 18 have well-determined Li abundances
        and 6 have Li upper limits. Our main finding is that there are
        no signatures of Li production in stars associated with the
        thick disk. Instead the Li abundance trend is decreasing with
        metallicity for these thick disk stars. Significant Li
        production is however seen in the thin disk, with a steady
        increase towards super-solar metallicities. At the highest
        metallicities, however, around [Fe/H] {\ensuremath{\approx}}
        +0.3, we tentatively confirm the recent discovery that the Li
        abundances level out. Our finding contradicts the other recent
        studies that found that Li is also produced in the thick disk.
        We find that this is likely due to the
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}}-enhancement criteria which those studies
        used to define their thick disk samples. By using the more
        robust age criteria, we are able to define a thick disk stellar
        sample that is much less contaminated by thin disk stars.
        Furthermore, we also tentatively confirm the age-Li correlation
        for solar twin stars, and we find that there is no correlation
        between Li abundance and whether the stars have detected
        exoplanets or not. The major conclusion that can be drawn from
        this study is that no significant Li production relative to the
        primordial abundance took place during the first few billion
        years of the Milky Way, an era coinciding with the formation and
        evolution of the thick disk. Significant Li enrichment then took
        place once long-lived low-mass stars (acting on a timescale
        longer than SNIa) had had time to contribute to the chemical
        enrichment of the interstellar medium. <P />This paper includes
